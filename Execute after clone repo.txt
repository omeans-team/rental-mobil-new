Enable the GD extension

Open your php.ini file, which is usually located at C:\xampp\php\php.ini.
Search for the line ;extension=gd and remove the semicolon at the beginning to uncomment it.
Save the changes to the php.ini file.
Restart your Apache server (or the web server you're using) to apply the changes.
Run composer install again to see if the issue is resolved.
